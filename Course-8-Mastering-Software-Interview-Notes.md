# Week-2
## TPS
### Tips
* Clarify problem
* Talk out loud about your talk process
* Listen to hints (Any errors)
* Follow-through and analysis
### Growth mindset prevent
* Imposter Syndrome
* Stereotype threats

# Week-3
## STAR METHOD
* Situation | Task
  * Mix Probs vs Sols
  * Assume too much
* Action | Result
  * In the weeds
  * Chronology

## Answering Questions
* Acknowledge the question asker
* Understand the question
* Tiein the question with your work
* Make sure you answered the question

# Week-4
## Strategy for solving problems
1. Ask questions
    * Tease out rel assumptions
    * Prob scope
    * Solution look like after analyzing 
2. Working through examples
    * Brainstomrm if it has special cases
    * Discover potential obstacles
    * Address some hidden assumptions and constrains
3. Build a naive sol
4. Start testing
    * Test normal | edge
    * Consider DS
    * Performace
    * Trade-offs
5. Iterate Design and Analysis
6. Implement

## Array 
- Sorted ?
- Mutable ?
- Duplicate ?

## Tips WBT Stratergy
* Meaningful name
* Keep alot of spaces
* i or j can be mistaken for semicolon
* Write big and legibly

* Always keep going
	* Revisit assumptions
	* Consider perf
	* Iterate sol
* Practice 
	* DS help ?
	* Apply or modify known algo


## Study Notes
### Data Structures and Abstract Data Types
* Arrays
* Linked Lists: single and double, with and without sentinel nodes
* The List ADT
* Trees: Binary and otherwise, BSTs
* The Set ADT
* Tries
* Heaps
* Stack, Queue and Priority Queue ADTs
* Graphs: directed and undirected, different representations and their trade-offs 
* Hashtables: collision resolution strategies, hash functions and their trade-offs
* The Map ADT
### Algorithms
* Binary search
* Sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort
* Search algorithms: Depth-first search, Breadth-first search, Dijkstra's algorithm
* Tree traversal: pre-order, post-order, in-order, level-order (which is BFS)
* Algorithm techniques: Brute force, Divide and conquer (e.g. Mergesort), Greedy, Dynamic * Programming (more advanced, OK not to know if you are at an intermediate level)
* NP-hard problems
### Basic Java Programming Constructs
* All the very basics of course (loops, conditionals, functions, etc)
* Input and output: from files and command line
* The String and Character class
* Converting between data types
* Object oriented design and concepts: Inheritance and Polymorphism, Classes and Objects, static * and non static, access level modifiers (public, private, protected)
* The java.util library (including all of the container classes)
* The Iterator pattern (more advanced, probably OK not to know if you are at an intermediate level)
* Exception generation and handling
* Event-driven programming
* Inner classes and anonymous classes (slightly more advanced, but good to know about)
* Lambda expressions (more advanced)
### Classes of problems to study
*Object oriented design, using given data structures.
*Bitwise manipulation of integer representations.
*Game theory puzzles: "muddy children", volcano eruptions.
*Estimating bounds: "how many chickens are there in Chicago?"
## Evaluate Criteria
