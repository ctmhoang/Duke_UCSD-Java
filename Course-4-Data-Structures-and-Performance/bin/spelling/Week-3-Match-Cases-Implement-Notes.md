# Implement MatchCase
* You probably want to allow the first letter in a non-capitalized word to be allowed to be capitalized, but you should not allow the first letter in a capitalized word to be non-capitalized (e.g. "Hello" should always be OK, but "christine" should not).
    * Use String methods pretty straight forward
* Words in all caps are also OK. E.g. HELLO or CHRISTINE
    * loop and checks if all chars are uppercase
